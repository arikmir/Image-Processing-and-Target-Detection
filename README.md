# Target-detection-and-Image-Processing
Target detection and Image Processing component of the UAV project, using Haar Cascade Classifier and script for ARUCO tag detection

**Project by ARIK INTENAM MIR, for EGH455 - QUT**
- **Codes are in Python**. 
- **Report Included**

 **Project Summary**
 
 The scripts in this repository were implemented for the purpose of image processing and detecting targets from the environment using Raspberry Pi Camera Module, stationed in a airborne UAV/drone. 
The scripts are created for two types of target-
