# Target-detection-and-Image-Processing
Target detection and Image Processing component of the UAV project, using Haar Cascade Classifier and script for ARUCO tag detection along with Client side code for transmitting data to the Ground Control Station

**Project by ARIK INTENAM MIR, for EGH455 - QUT**
- **Codes are in Python**. 
- **Report Included**

 **Project Summary**
 
 The scripts in this repository were implemented for the purpose of image processing and detecting targets from the environment using Raspberry Pi Camera Module, stationed in a airborne UAV/drone. This repo also contains scripts for transmitting data from the airborne drone with the Ground Control Station(GCS).
The scripts are created for two types of target-
1. Normal target markers
2. ARUCO tag markers
